## Per-Asset Review

### BTC — UNCHANGED ✅
- **Price:** $67,171 (vs thesis $66,381). Marginal move, still well above buy zone ($40-50K).
- **Fundamentals:** No change. Bear regime intact. 200W SMA ~$52K still well below price.
- **Catalysts:** None triggered. Waiting for cycle low per ITC framework.
- **Predictions:** All 5 open, no resolution triggers.
- **Action:** None. Continue watching for $55-60K watch zone entry.

### HYPE — UNCHANGED ✅
- **Price:** $29.15 (vs thesis $28.74). Above watch zone ($22-26).
- **TVL:** $4.25B, down from $4.64B (-8.4%). Minor decline, likely market-correlated.
- **Fundamentals:** Buybacks still active per DeFiLlama. No HIP-4 launch yet.
- **Catalysts:** No new triggers. HIP-4 (options) remains key catalyst.
- **Predictions:** All 5 open. HYPE-P3 (HyperEVM TVL >$1B): current HyperEVM TVL ~$323M per DeFiLlama breakdown — tracking but well below target.
- **Action:** None. Price needs ~25% decline to reach buy zone.

### AAVE — UNCHANGED ✅
- **Price:** $123.71 (vs thesis $122.36). Slight uptick, still above watch zone ($105-115).
- **TVL:** $27.0B (vs thesis $26.8B). Stable, slight growth. Borrowed: $17.05B.
- **Fundamentals:** Revenue, buybacks, and market share all intact. No ETF decision yet.
- **Catalysts:** Grayscale ETF still pending. $50M/yr buyback continuing.
- **Predictions:** All 5 open. No resolution triggers.
- **Action:** None. Monitor for watch zone entry at $115.

### MORPHO — UPGRADED ⬆️ (Signal Filed)
- **Price:** $1.44 (vs thesis $1.45). Flat.
- **TVL:** $5.72B — UP 56% from thesis value of $3.66B. This is a material change.
- **Analysis:** TVL jumped from $3.66B to $5.72B. This is the largest single-period TVL move across all covered assets. If sustained, MORPHO-P1 ($8B EOY target) becomes achievable much sooner than expected. The institutional adoption thesis (Coinbase, Ondo, Taurus) appears to be accelerating. Morpho is now at ~21% of Aave's TVL, up from ~14%.
- **Fundamentals:** Fee switch still OFF. No protocol revenue. But TVL growth de-risks the "when fee switch flips, there's real volume to monetize" thesis.
- **Predictions:** MORPHO-P1 ($8B TVL): was 46% of target, now 71%. Tracking ahead of schedule. MORPHO-P4 (>20% incremental TVL share): strong evidence this is happening given +$2B growth.
- **Action:** thesis_update signal filed. Recommend reviewing whether watch/buy zones should tighten given accelerating fundamentals. Conviction upgrade from 8→9 warranted if TVL sustains >$5B for 2 weeks. **Investigate source of TVL spike** — is it a single large vault or broad-based?

### PENDLE — UNCHANGED ✅
- **Price:** $1.20 (vs thesis $1.19). Flat.
- **TVL:** $2.45B (vs thesis $2.56B). Down 4.3%, consistent with bear market yield compression.
- **Fundamentals:** Fee switch ON, 80% buybacks active. Monopoly position intact. 11 chains deployed (added Plasma since thesis).
- **Catalysts:** No new triggers. RWA yield tokenization and new chain deployments remain key.
- **Predictions:** All 5 open. PENDLE-P1 ($4B TVL): currently at 61% — needs yield recovery. PENDLE-P2 (2 new chains >$50M): Plasma and Sonic deployments live but TVL data TBD.
- **Action:** None. Approaching watch zone ($1.00-1.10) — another 8-17% decline puts it in range.

## Summary Table

| Asset | Status | Conviction | Signal Filed? |
|-------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| BTC | Unchanged | 9 | No |
| HYPE | Unchanged | 8 | No |
| AAVE | Unchanged | 7 | No |
| MORPHO | **Upgraded** | 8→pending 9 | **Yes** |
| PENDLE | Unchanged | 7 | No |

## Key Takeaway
Bear regime continues. All assets trading above buy zones. The standout is **MORPHO's 56% TVL surge** — needs investigation into whether this is broad-based institutional inflows or a single-vault anomaly. If broad-based, this significantly strengthens the thesis and may warrant tighter entry levels. All other theses intact with no material changes.
