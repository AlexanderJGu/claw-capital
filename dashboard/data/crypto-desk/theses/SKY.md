## 1. One-Line Thesis

Sky is the rebranded MakerDAO — the largest decentralized stablecoin protocol with $5.83B TVL, real revenue from RWA lending (T-bills, institutional credit), active buybacks, and a governance token trading at a massive discount to protocol assets — the "boring but profitable" DeFi thesis.

## 2. The Narrative

MakerDAO (now Sky) is the OG of DeFi. DAI (now USDS) has been the Schelling point for decentralized stablecoins since 2019. The protocol generates revenue by charging stability fees on collateralized debt positions — essentially, it's a decentralized central bank that profits from the spread between its borrowing cost (0%) and the yield on its collateral (4-5% on T-bills).

The transformation from MakerDAO to Sky included aggressive RWA integration — the protocol holds billions in US T-bills, institutional credit facilities, and other real-world assets as collateral backing USDS. This means Sky earns ~4-5% on its collateral base of $5.83B — implying ~$230-290M in annualized revenue. This is one of the highest revenue-to-TVL ratios in DeFi.

The tokenomics have improved: active buybacks per DeFiLlama, plus staking rewards for SKY stakers. The rebrand from MKR to SKY introduced a significantly higher token supply (dilution), which confused the market and contributed to the depressed price. But the underlying economics are unchanged — this is the most profitable protocol in DeFi by some metrics.

The honest assessment: Sky is the "value stock" of DeFi. It won't 10x in a month, but it generates real revenue, has a massive TVL moat, and trades at a discount to peers on a revenue basis. The bear case is that the rebrand was botched, retail has moved on, and SKY tokenomics are dilutive. But for a bear-market accumulation watchlist, the fundamentals are hard to argue with.

## 3. Fundamentals

### Protocol Metrics
| Metric | Value | Trend | Comparable |
|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| TVL (Ethereum) | $5.83B | Stable/growing | Aave: $26.8B |
| Staking TVL | $625M | Growing | — |
| USDS/DAI Outstanding | ~$5B+ (est.) | Stable | USDT: $140B, USDC: $50B |
| Protocol Revenue (est. annualized) | ~$230-290M (4-5% on TVL) | Stable with rates | — |
| FDV | TBD — need supply data | — | — |
| Circulating Mcap | TBD — CoinGecko gecko_id "sky" | — | — |
| Buybacks | Active | Per DeFiLlama | — |

### Tokenomics
- **Supply schedule:** SKY token replaced MKR at a 24,000:1 ratio. Total supply significantly higher than MKR. This dilution confused the market.
- **Value accrual:** Buybacks active (per DeFiLlama). Staking rewards for SKY stakers. Governance rights. Revenue from stability fees flows to protocol surplus, which funds buybacks.
- **Holder distribution:** DAO-governed. a16z and other early MKR holders converted to SKY. Endgame plan introduced SubDAOs — adding complexity.

### Competitive Position
- **Moat:** Longest-running DeFi protocol. USDS/DAI is the most integrated decentralized stablecoin — accepted across virtually every DeFi protocol. RWA collateral base earns real yield. Regulatory Lindy effect.
- **Competitors:** USDC (centralized, larger), USDT (centralized, dominant), GHO (Aave's stablecoin, growing). Frax (smaller). Ethena/USDe (delta-neutral, different model).
- **Market share:** Largest decentralized stablecoin by TVL. ~5% of total stablecoin market. Dominant in its niche.

## 4. Catalysts

| Catalyst | Timeframe | Impact | Probability |
|----------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| RWA yield environment remains high (4%+ rates) | 2026 | High — revenue scales with rates | High |
| USDS adoption growth (DeFi integrations) | Ongoing | Medium | Medium |
| SubDAO ecosystem development | 2026-2027 | Medium — ecosystem expansion | Medium |
| Rate cut cycle → Sky pivots to crypto collateral | 2026-2028 | Medium — narrative shift | Medium |
| Stablecoin regulatory clarity | 2026-2027 | High — legitimizes decentralized model | Medium |

## 5. Bear Case (Required — Non-Negligible)

1. **Interest rate risk:** Sky's revenue depends heavily on T-bill yields. If Fed cuts aggressively and rates drop to 2% or below, Sky's revenue halves. The protocol would need to shift collateral mix back to crypto (higher risk, lower yield) or find new revenue sources.

2. **Rebrand confusion:** The MKR → SKY transition was poorly received. Many investors don't understand the new token, the 24,000:1 ratio feels dilutive, and the "Sky" brand has less recognition than "MakerDAO." This depresses retail demand.

3. **Competition risk:** GHO (Aave) and USDe (Ethena) are growing stablecoins backed by protocols with stronger narrative momentum. If USDS/DAI loses its integration moat (DeFi protocols start preferring GHO or USDe), the competitive advantage erodes.

4. **Complexity risk:** The Endgame plan introduced SubDAOs, new token tiers, and governance complexity. This confuses existing holders and makes it harder for new investors to understand the value proposition.

5. **Regulatory risk:** As the largest decentralized stablecoin, USDS/DAI is a prime target for stablecoin regulation. If regulators require stablecoin issuers to be licensed banks (a real possibility), Sky's decentralized model faces existential risk.

## 6. Price Levels & Structure

### HTF Structure
- **Trend:** Extended downtrend from MKR ATH. SKY token in price discovery after rebrand.
- **Timeframe:** Daily/Weekly
- **Key observation:** Trading at ~$0.066, above watch zone. Need 9-17% pullback to reach watch zone.

### Levels
| Level | Price | Type | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| R1 | $0.080 | Resistance | — |
| Current | $0.066 | — | Feb 25, 2026 |
| S1 / Watch Upper | $0.060 | Watch zone top | |
| S2 / Watch Lower | $0.055 | Watch zone bottom / Buy zone top | |
| S3 / Buy Core | $0.052 | Buy zone core | |
| S4 / Buy Lower | $0.048 | Buy zone bottom | |
| S5 | $0.040 | Major support | Capitulation |
| Invalidation | $0.035 | Hard stop | |

### Trade Plan
- **Buy zone:** $0.048–$0.055 (requires ~17-27% decline)
- **Watch zone:** $0.055–$0.060 (requires ~9-17% decline)
- **Targets:** TP1: $0.10, TP2: $0.15, TP3: $0.20
- **Invalidation:** $0.035 (revenue collapse or regulatory existential threat)
- **R:R at current price ($0.066):** ~1.1:1 to TP1 ($0.10) vs stop ($0.035) — NOT ATTRACTIVE
- **R:R at base entry ($0.052):** ~2.8:1 to TP1 ($0.10) vs stop ($0.035) — MODERATE

## 7. Position Sizing

- **Max allocation:** 3% of portfolio
- **Scaling plan:** 3-tranche DCA within buy zone ($0.048-$0.055)
- **Correlation note:** Correlated with DeFi sector and ETH. Revenue partially decorrelated (RWA yield driven by TradFi rates). Adds rate exposure to portfolio.

## 8. Testable Predictions (Required — Automated Tracking)

| ID | Prediction | Metric | Target | Deadline | Category | Status |
|----|-----------|--------|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| SKY-P1 | USDS/DAI combined outstanding exceeds $6B | stablecoin_outstanding_usd | 6000000000 | 2026-12-31 | fundamental | open |
| SKY-P2 | Sky protocol revenue exceeds $200M annualized (sustained 3+ months) | protocol_revenue_annualized | 200000000 | 2026-09-30 | fundamental | open |
| SKY-P3 | At least 2 SubDAOs launch with >$100M TVL each | subdao_launches_100m | 2 | 2026-12-31 | catalyst | open |
| SKY-P4 | SKY buyback volume exceeds $20M in 2026 | annual_buyback_volume_usd | 20000000 | 2026-12-31 | fundamental | open |

**Critical predictions:** SKY-P1, SKY-P2 — if stablecoin supply stagnates and revenue doesn't hit $200M, the "boring but profitable" thesis weakens.

## 9. Review Schedule

- **Next review:** 2026-03-25 (monthly)
- **Review trigger:** Price enters watch zone ($0.060), Fed rate decision, stablecoin regulation news, SubDAO launches
- **Invalidation criteria:**
  - Price below $0.035 for 3+ days
  - USDS/DAI supply drops below $3B
  - Major smart contract exploit or oracle failure
  - Stablecoin regulation banning decentralized issuance
  - Revenue drops below $100M annualized
- **Critical prediction miss:** Automatic review triggered if SKY-P1 or SKY-P2 misses
