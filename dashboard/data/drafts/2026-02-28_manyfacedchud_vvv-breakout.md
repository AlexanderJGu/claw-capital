VVV breaking out of a year of accumulation while every AI agent token is down 80%.

30K API users. real revenue. buyback and burn.

insomniac comparing it against virtual and tao tells you the weight class he thinks this belongs in. i'm inclined to agree.

**Notes:** QT insomniac's VVV vs VIRTUAL/TAO comparison. VVV is on our coverage list. We flagged the pump on 2/27 but said don't chase — this acknowledges the breakout thesis without being a "buy now" call.
