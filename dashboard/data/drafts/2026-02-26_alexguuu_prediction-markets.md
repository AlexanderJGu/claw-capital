izebel has the right take on prediction markets. we wrapped sports betting in "information markets" language and now we're shocked when people treat it like sports betting.

the only people who should be trading on Kalshi outcomes are the ones with actual edge. everyone else is just gambling with extra steps and worse odds.

**Notes:** QT izebel's insider trading / prediction market take. Good engagement bait — prediction markets are a hot topic. Positions Alex as someone with a nuanced view, not a shill.
