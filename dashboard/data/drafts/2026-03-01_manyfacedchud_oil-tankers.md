oil longs entered at $59 are basically free trades now. stop at entry, unlimited upside if strait of hormuz heats up.

but the real play is tankers. iran is the catalyst but the structural bid was already there before any of this.

funny how the best risk/reward is always in the thing nobody's watching.

**Notes:** Adapts Citrini's oil/tanker thesis for a degen trading audience. The "free trade" framing and "nobody's watching" kicker are manyfacedchud voice. Quote-tweeting Citrini adds source credibility. Crosses over from pure crypto — shows range.
