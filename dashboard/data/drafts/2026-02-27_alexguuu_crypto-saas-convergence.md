the most interesting thing happening in crypto right now isn't price action. it's the convergence of SaaS payments and onchain rails.

AI agents need to pay each other. they can't fill out stripe forms. crypto is the default economic layer for machine-to-machine commerce.

this isn't a 2024 "AI agent" narrative play. this is infrastructure that's getting built right now, quietly.

**Notes:** Riffs on insomniac's SaaS-to-crypto observation but from Alex's builder perspective. Doesn't mention insomniac (keeps @alexguuu voice distinct from @manyfacedchud). Positions Alex as someone who thinks about infra, not just apps.
