$BTC sitting right on the 2024 breakout zone ($65-73K).

this was resistance for 6 months before the move to $108K. now it's the last line of defense.

if this zone fails, $60K is next. if it holds, it's the highest R/R long of the cycle.

don't get cute in the middle. wait for the answer.

**Media:** Could screenshot BTC daily chart with zone marked
**Notes:** Synthesizes insomniac's "don't get lost in the chop" take + KillaXBT's $60K target. Conviction without picking a direction — lets the structure do the talking.
