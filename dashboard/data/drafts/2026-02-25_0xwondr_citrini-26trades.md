citrini just dropped the paywall on their "26 Trades for 2026" report. if you haven't read it yet, this is the single best macro framework i've seen for navigating the AI transition.

core thesis: AI makes atoms scarce relative to bits. physical infrastructure, energy, defense, commodities — these are the trades. software margins compress, SaaS multiples die.

agree or disagree, you need to have a view on this. everything else is derivative.
