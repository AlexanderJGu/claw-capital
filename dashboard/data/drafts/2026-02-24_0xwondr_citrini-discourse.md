the citrini piece has been bouncing around CT for a week now and the discourse is actually productive for once

both sides agree: short SaaS, long physical scarcity, the transition is painful

where they disagree is how bad the contagion gets. -15% drawdown or -38%.

most likely path imo: sloppy, painful, but manageable. the institutions with real physical infra moats (compute, energy, subsea) eat everything. the paper pushers get restructured.

the question isn't IF the disruption happens. it's whether the plumbing holds while it does.

**Notes:** Synthesizes the week-long discourse without picking a hard side. Shows independent thinking. Framework-oriented per 0xwondr voice. Could link to plur_daddy's rebuttal thread or Citrini original.
