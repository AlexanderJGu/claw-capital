health apps are a cheat code right now:

- $0.63 revenue per install (2x the median category)
- every transformation = free UGC content
- the audience literally WANTS to be sold to

the hard part isn't building. it's picking which one to build first when there are 5 obvious gaps in the market.

**Media:** none
**Quote tweet:** none
**Notes:** Building-in-public style. Shows Alex's research depth without revealing the specific app ideas. Creates engagement bait — people will ask "which 5 gaps?" Good for replies/engagement.
