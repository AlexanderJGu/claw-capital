iran strikes and BTC barely flinched. market is conditioned to treat every escalation as "one and done" — plur is right that this time the odds of gradual escalation are higher.

but crypto doesn't care. it's becoming the geopolitical hedge it was always supposed to be. the bid is real.

**Notes:** QT plur's Iran escalation take. Ties in insomniac's "crypto actually holding up very well" observation. Short, conviction-oriented. Doesn't hedge.
