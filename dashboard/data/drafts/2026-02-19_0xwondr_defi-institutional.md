1/ the most interesting thing happening in crypto right now isn't memecoins or L2s

it's that tradfi is quietly entering DeFi lending at scale

citadel, DTCC, NYSE — all building on-chain credit rails. and there are maybe 3 protocols positioned to capture this.

2/ the winners will be protocols that offer:
- risk isolation (curated pools, not monolithic)
- institutional-grade partnerships (Coinbase, Circle)
- actual revenue (not governance token hopium)

most "DeFi blue chips" fail at least one of these

3/ MORPHO and AAVE are the two obvious plays, but they're very different bets:

AAVE = the incumbent. $26B TVL, dominant market share. but slow-moving, and monolithic pool architecture means you can't isolate risk the way institutions want

MORPHO = the challenger. curated pools, Coinbase partnership, team that ships fast. smaller ($3.6B TVL) but architecturally better positioned for institutional needs

4/ the dark horse is that DeFi lending becomes the "AWS of finance" — infrastructure so good that tradfi builds on top of it rather than competing

if that happens, protocol revenue multiples reprice dramatically

we're very early in that repricing
