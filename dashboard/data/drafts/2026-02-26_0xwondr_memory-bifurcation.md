a thesis i've been working through: the memory market is bifurcating, and it matters for how you think about the entire AI supply chain.

thread 🧵

1/ HBM (the memory AI actually needs) stays short for years. packaging is the bottleneck, not wafer capacity. new fabs can't qualify fast enough.

2/ commodity DRAM and NAND (phones, PCs, SSDs) is about to face a supply glut. new fabs that can't serve AI are flooding the consumer market instead. China's CXMT and YMTC are ramping hard.

3/ key insight from the SMIC CEO: channel distributors are hoarding inventory ahead of the expected shortage. when they start liquidating, it's a double whammy — new supply + inventory dump simultaneously.

4/ the market hasn't priced this bifurcation. names like MU are trading as "AI beneficiaries" when ~50% of revenue is commodity-exposed. the HBM tailwind doesn't offset a commodity DRAM pricing collapse.

5/ this is a citrini-style "atoms vs bits" dynamic playing out within semis. the scarce thing (HBM packaging capacity) gets more valuable. the abundant thing (commodity memory fabs) gets cheaper.

framework, not a trade rec. but the asymmetry is obvious if the thesis is right.

**Notes:** This is 0xwondr's best draft today — original thesis work, framework-oriented, references Citrini without shilling. Positions the account as doing real research. Thread format suits the complexity. Daniel Wu credit omitted to keep sources vague (anon account).
