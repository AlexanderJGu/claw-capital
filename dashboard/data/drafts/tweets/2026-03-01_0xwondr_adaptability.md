the druckenmiller framework in one line: your thesis is a hypothesis, not an identity.

most traders fail because they marry positions. the best ones treat every trade like a falsifiable experiment — if the data changes, the position changes. no ego.

this is why regime frameworks matter more than price targets. you're not trying to predict where price goes. you're trying to know what game you're playing so you can change your behavior when the game changes.

the shift from "i think BTC goes to X" to "we're in accumulation/distribution/bear and here's how i behave in each" is the entire edge.

**Notes:** Framework post that elevates insomniac's adaptability take into a broader trading philosophy. Ties into the regime framework Oracle actually uses for Claw Capital. Doesn't make specific calls — pure thesis. Good for @0xwondr's "thinker" brand.
