saturday night and i'm deep in market research docs my AI agent generated while i was sleeping.

the leverage of one person + good agents is absurd. i used to need a cofounder to cover the stuff i didn't want to do. now i just need better prompts.

the solo founder era isn't coming. it's here.

**Media:** none
**Quote tweet:** none
**Notes:** Personal, authentic. Ties into Alex's recent solo pivot after Varun partnership. Doesn't name Oracle or specific tools — keeps it relatable. Saturday night posting feels natural.
