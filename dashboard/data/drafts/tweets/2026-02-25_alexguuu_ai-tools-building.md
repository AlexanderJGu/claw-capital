# Tweet Draft

the gap between "i have an idea" and "it's live in the app store" is now about 72 hours for a solo dev with taste

the gap between "it's live" and "people actually use it" is still infinite

distribution is the only moat left. always has been, but now it's undeniable.

**Media:** none
**Quote tweet:** none
**Notes:** Builds on the solo-building narrative without repeating yesterday's "distribution > engineering" tweet. More specific — references the actual timeline Alex is experiencing in Sprint 1. Good standalone take that doesn't require context.
