the memory market is splitting in two and most people haven't noticed

HBM: short for years. packaging bottleneck, can't qualify new capacity fast enough.

commodity DRAM/NAND: about to drown. china ramping, channel hoarding, new fabs dumping into consumer.

SK Hynix > Micron is the cleanest expression of this. one is HBM-dominant, the other is commodity-exposed.

**Media:** none
**Quote tweet:** none
**Notes:** More analytical version of the memory thesis. Gives a pair trade idea (SK Hynix vs MU) which is a strong anon trader move. Can post this OR the MU one — probably not both same day.
