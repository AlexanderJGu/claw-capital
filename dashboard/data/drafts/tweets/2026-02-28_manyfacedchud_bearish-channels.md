most alts still in bearish channels. the ones that aren't — hype, vvv, zro — are telling you something.

in a market where everything looks like it wants lower, the coins that refuse to break down are the ones you want exposure to when the turn comes.

small list > big list right now.

**Notes:** Synthesizes insomniac's two takes (bearish channels + small watchlist). The "small list" framing is very manyfacedchud voice — distilled conviction.
