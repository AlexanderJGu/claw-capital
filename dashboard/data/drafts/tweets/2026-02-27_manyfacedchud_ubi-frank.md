frank nailing it: "ubi → hypergambling in the crypto casino"

the labor displacement → government checks → onchain speculation pipeline is so obvious and nobody's pricing it in.

blue collar protected by Moravec's Paradox. white collar gets replaced first. displaced knowledge workers with UBI checks and zero purpose are the most degenerate gamblers you've ever seen.

bullish crypto volumes. bearish society.

**Notes:** QT frank's UBI take. Connects to our Citrini AI bull/bear synthesis — labor displacement is the core thesis. The "bearish society" kicker gives it edge. Fits manyfacedchud's dark humor tone.
