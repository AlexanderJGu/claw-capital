insomniac asking "what are the best projects focusing on crypto as the economic layer for AI"

this is the question for the next 12 months. not "AI agents trading memecoins" — actual payment rails and proof-of-service infrastructure.

SaaS companies forced to move onchain for agentic payments. ZK for proof of fulfillment. the plumbing, not the memes.

most people are still looking at this through the 2024 AI agent meta lens. wrong frame.

**Notes:** QT insomniac's question about crypto as AI economic layer. Positions manyfacedchud as thinking about infra, not tokens. Good thread starter if Alex wants to expand.
