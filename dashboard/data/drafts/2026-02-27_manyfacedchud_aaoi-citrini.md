Citrini posting his AAOI chart with "could have just held this and bypassed the entire equity research arc"

$2 to $73. +3100%. applied optoelectronics. fiber optics for data centers.

the photonics trade has been staring everyone in the face for 2 years. COHR, LITE, AAOI — anything moving light instead of electrons for AI compute.

most people missed it because it didn't have "AI" in the ticker name.

**Notes:** QT Citrini's AAOI regret. Ties into our photonics thesis (Crux Capital research). AAOI is NOT on our coverage list but the structural take on photonics is consistent with our thesis work. manyfacedchud voice = conviction, not hedging.
