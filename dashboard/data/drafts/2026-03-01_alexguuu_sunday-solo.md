the most productive weekends of my life have all been solo

no standups. no "quick sync." no waiting on someone to review my PR. just me, my agents, and whatever i'm shipping that day.

people romanticize co-founders but nobody talks about the 6 months you spend realizing you have different standards.

**Media:** none
**Quote tweet:** none
**Notes:** Authentic solo founder reflection. Doesn't name-drop specific tools or projects. References the Varun split implicitly without being bitter — just honest. Sunday afternoon energy.
