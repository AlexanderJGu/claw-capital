## Korea (KRX / ADR)

### Tier 1 — High Conviction Names

**SK Hynix (000660.KS)**
- THE memory play. HBM leader, first HBM4 shipments to NVIDIA imminent (Jensen dinner confirmed Feb 14)
- Nomura forecasts: OP ₩130.8T/₩184.8T for 2026/27
- Commodity DRAM +90% QoQ Q1'26, NAND +60% QoQ
- Memory super cycle — "supply-demand imbalance will continue until 2030" (Jukan)
- ADR: not available. Must trade on KRX via IBKR

**Samsung Electronics (005930.KS)**
- First HBM4 mass production shipper (TrendForce). P4 fab pulled forward to Q4.
- Foundry bundling leverage: ByteDance buying foundry to secure memory supply
- HBM4 20% price premium — "maximum profitability strategy"
- Trades ~8-9x fwd PE. Nomura raising OP forecasts.
- BUT: execution risk vs SK Hynix, foundry still losing to TSMC
- ADR: not directly. Can trade via KRX or SSNLF (OTC, illiquid)

**Samsung Electro-Mechanics (009150.KS)**
- MLCC + ABF substrate dual catalyst
- Citrini/Jukan highlighted: ABF supercycle entering "strong rebound phase"
- Pure play on passive components for AI servers

### Tier 2 — Watch

**Hanmi Semiconductor (042700.KS)**
- HBM packaging equipment — thermal compression bonder (TCB) leader
- Directly levered to HBM4 ramp

**Ibiden (4062.T — Japan, but relevant)**
- Jukan's explicit ABF substrate pick. ABF supply bottleneck play.

**Kioxia (285A.T — Japan)**
- NAND pure play. "There won't be a second shock" — Daishin expects NAND surprise
- Listed Oct 2024, still finding its footing

## Hong Kong / China (HKEX)

### Tier 1 — High Conviction

**Alibaba (9988.HK / BABA)**
- Plans 22-25 GW of AI DC capacity by 2032 (Zephyr)
- Qwen AI already driving real commerce (25 RMB coupon viral moment)
- Cheapest of China big tech on earnings basis
- US ADR: BABA

**Tencent (0700.HK / TCEHY)**
- AI integration across WeChat ecosystem, gaming AI
- Most diversified China tech conglomerate
- Steady buyback program

**SMIC (0981.HK / SMICY)**
- China's leading foundry. Government ban risk BUT domestic demand is captive
- US proposed ban on government use of SMIC products — overhang but also moat for domestic customers
- Zephyr: "China caught up to US in chip design by 2018-19" — SMIC is the manufacturing bottleneck

### Tier 2 — Watch

**BYD (1211.HK / BYDDY)**
- Not pure semi but auto + battery + chip vertical integration
- Semiconductor division spun out (BYD Semi) — future IPO catalyst

**CXMT (private — watch for IPO)**
- China's domestic DRAM champion. Apple reportedly exploring partnership (Jukan)
- If listed, would be significant

**Hua Hong Semiconductor (1347.HK)**
- Specialty/mature node foundry. Less geopolitical risk than SMIC

## Macro Context

### Key Themes (from Jukan/Zephyr)
1. **Memory super cycle**: DRAM/NAND shortage through 2030. HBM4 transition = pricing power
2. **ABF supercycle**: Taiwan PCB sector in "strong rebound phase" from AI server demand
3. **China AI capex surprise**: Chinese + SEA buildout will surprise to upside (Zephyr)
4. **Foundry bundling**: Samsung leveraging memory shortage to win foundry orders
5. **SemiAnalysis starting VC fund**: based16z flags as classic top signal for US semi names
6. **Korean index mispriced**: $EWY options potentially mispriced per vol arb analysis (aleabitoreddit)

### Risks
- US-China export controls escalation (SMIC, CXMT directly exposed)
- Memory price correction: China traders reporting "sharp decline" in spot memory prices (Jukan: "extent of correction is limited")
- Samsung execution risk: consistently behind SK Hynix on HBM qualification
- Geopolitical (Taiwan strait, Korea-specific)

## New Accounts to Grade
- **@aleabitoreddit** — Korean semi vol arb, SIMO/NAND trades, Phison/memory supply chain. Quality content, needs Alex's grade.
- **@Evan_ss6** — Samsung investor, fundamental analysis. Smaller account.
- **@tphuang** — Force projection / geopolitical tracking. Useful for defense/macro overlay.
