a whale fat-fingered an order on Lighter yesterday. system handled it in prod without breaking.

this is why you care about orderbook DEX infrastructure. the stress tests that matter aren't the ones you plan — they're the ones that happen on a random wednesday.

LIT is doing what most DeFi protocols claim to do: processing real volume from real whales in production. the FUD threads tell you more about the critics than the protocol.

**Notes:** QT izebel's LIT defense. Fits 0xwondr's builder/framework voice — not a trade call, just noting infrastructure resilience. LIT is on our coverage list.
