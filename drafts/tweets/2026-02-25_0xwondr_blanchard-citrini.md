**Source:** Citrini RT of Blanchard on AI and interest rates

---

blanchard weighing in on the citrini thesis now. specifically on AI and r*.

the argument: if AI drives higher growth, real rates go up. which means the "AI makes everything cheaper" crowd needs to reckon with tighter financial conditions during the transition.

this is the part most people skip. deflation in output prices doesn't mean deflation in cost of capital. the transition has real financing costs.

the positioning implication is clear: long the stuff that generates real cash flow today, not the stuff that needs cheap capital to survive.

**Notes:** Blanchard (Olivier Blanchard, former IMF chief economist) commented on Citrini's AI thesis re: interest rates. This elevates the discourse — shows 0xwondr is tracking the macro econ angle, not just crypto takes. Framework-oriented as per voice guidelines.
