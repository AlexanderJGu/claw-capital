$8.4B options expiry friday. max pain $75K.

insomniac's right — short squeezes are catching late shorts but the structure hasn't changed. most of this bleeds back.

don't confuse a squeeze with a reversal. seen this movie before.

**Media:** none
**Quote tweet:** none
**Notes:** Ties two data points together (options + insomniac's take). Contrarian to the "bottom is in" crowd. Consistent with bear regime stance.
