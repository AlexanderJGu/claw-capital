framework for navigating this:

1. BTC below 200D MA with declining momentum = bear regime until proven otherwise
2. geopolitical risk (Iran) adds tail risk that pure chart readers miss
3. DeFi blue chips (AAVE, MORPHO, HYPE) are still accumulation targets — but at lower levels, not here
4. cash allocation should be 50%+ until structure reclaims

the mistake people make in drawdowns is treating every -10% as "the bottom." bottoms are a process, not an event.

zoom out. the protocols you want to own in 2027 are getting cheaper every week. that's good. let it happen.

**Media:** none
**Quote tweet:** none
**Notes:** Framework-oriented, fits 0xwondr voice. Not a trade call — a mental model for navigating bear regime. References specific protocols (AAVE, MORPHO, HYPE) from our coverage. The "bottoms are a process" line is the key takeaway.
