**Source:** insomniac SOL chart analysis — $120 support break

---

SOL lost $120 on volume. that was THE level — held as support through the entire 2024-2025 cycle.

former support = resistance now. every bounce into $120 is a sell until proven otherwise.

structure is broken. full stop.

---

**Media:** SOL daily chart showing $120 break
**Notes:** Clean structural call. Insomniac showed this clearly — $120 held multiple times, broke with conviction. Simple and directional.
