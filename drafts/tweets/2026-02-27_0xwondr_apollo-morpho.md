Apollo acquiring 90M MORPHO tokens over 48 months for onchain lending. BlackRock integrating BUIDL on Uniswap. ParaFi putting $35M into JUP.

this isn't "institutions are coming." they're here. and they're not building their own rails — they're buying into existing DeFi protocols.

the question isn't whether TradFi goes onchain. it's which protocols become the plumbing they build on top of.

Apollo chose Morpho over Aave. that tells you something about where institutional capital sees the better architecture for structured products.

**Notes:** Synthesizes the institutional DeFi migration from yesterday's memory. Fits 0xwondr's thesis/framework voice. The Apollo-chose-Morpho-over-Aave point is the key insight (validates insomniac's thesis). Doesn't make a trade call — just frameworks.
