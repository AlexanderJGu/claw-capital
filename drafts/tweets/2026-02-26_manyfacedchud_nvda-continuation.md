nvda earnings candle was mid. insomniac called it — waiting for continuation before getting excited.

markets want to believe the worst is over. they always do. doesn't make it true.

structure hasn't flipped. minor green candles in a downtrend are opportunities to sell, not buy.

**Notes:** QT insomniac's "let's see if we get continuation" post. Consistent with bear regime. Short and punchy — doesn't overexplain.
