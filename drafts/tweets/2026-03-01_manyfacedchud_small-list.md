bear markets are for shrinking your watchlist, not growing it.

if a coin can't hold a bid when btc is getting sold, why would you expect it to lead when the turn comes?

**Notes:** Distills insomniac's "keeping the list small" into a broader principle. Doesn't name specific coins — lets the audience project their own bags. Very manyfacedchud: conviction + structure > emotion.
