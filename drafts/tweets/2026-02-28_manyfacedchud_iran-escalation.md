market pricing this Iran strike as a one-and-done like the last 3 rounds

plur is right — gradual escalation odds are high this time. different administration, different incentive structure.

BTC at $63K and alts getting slaughtered. if you're buying this dip you better have a thesis beyond "it went down"

**Notes:** QT plur_daddy's Iran escalation take. Timely — BTC dumped to $63K today. Cautious tone consistent with bear regime. Not calling direction, just warning against mindless dip buying.
