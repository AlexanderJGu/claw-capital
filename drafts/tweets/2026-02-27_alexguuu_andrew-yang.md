Block went from 10K to 6K employees. not because they're struggling — because AI tools made the other 4K unnecessary.

Jack didn't cut costs. he cut humans.

Andrew Yang ran on UBI in 2020 and everyone called him crazy. now the CEO of a $40B company is proving his thesis in real time.

the timeline where we need UBI isn't 2040. it's 2027.

**Notes:** QT frank's Yang tweet. Ties in Block layoffs from yesterday's memory (frank's own earlier take). Alex's voice here is more analytical than manyfacedchud — same data, different framing. This positions Alex as someone thinking about macro implications, not just trading them.
