HYPE at $28 and insomniac calling the inverse H&S a failed breakout

BTC dumping 3%, ETH down 5.7%. not the time to be a hero on alts.

the market gives you one or two clean setups a month. this isn't one of them. patience > conviction when structure is messy.

**Notes:** QT insomniac's chart review. Cautious tone, consistent with bear regime. Not bearish on HYPE long-term, just timing.
