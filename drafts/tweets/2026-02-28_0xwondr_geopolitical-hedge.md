the iran situation is interesting from a crypto lens.

market's been conditioned by 2 years of "strike → dump → recover in 48 hours." each time, the recovery gets faster. each time, the correlation to trad risk-off weakens.

crypto isn't decorrelating because of some narrative shift. it's decorrelating because the marginal buyer today is structurally different — sovereign wealth, corporate treasuries, ETF flows — and they don't panic-sell on geopolitical headlines the way retail did in 2022.

the geopolitical hedge thesis is being proven in real time, one conflict at a time.

**Notes:** Framework-oriented take on crypto resilience during Iran escalation. Fits 0xwondr's thesis voice — explains the WHY, not just the what. Doesn't make a trade call.
