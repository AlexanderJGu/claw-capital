## 💡 Actionable for IBKR

### Conviction Strengthened
- **SK Hynix (000660.KS):** Everything aligning — Jensen dinner, export ATH, HBM4 sold out, Japan fab expansion. 5.7x fwd PE is absurd. Strongest name on the desk.
- **Samsung (005930.KS):** HBM4 exclusive Rubin supplier is the re-rate catalyst we've been waiting for. 7.9x fwd PE with $227B OP by 2027. The foundry bundling play adds another lever.
- **Samsung E-M (009150.KS):** ABF supercycle + glass fiber shortage = double tailwind for substrate/MLCC names.

### New Names to Research
- **Mitsui Kinzoku (5706.T)** — Zephyr highlight, copper foil for PCBs. Worth a deep dive.
- **MEC (4971.T)** — Specialty chemicals for PCB manufacturing. Zephyr highlight.
- **SIMO (NASDAQ)** — NAND controller duopoly. Direct memory cycle leverage via US-listed stock.
- **Insilico (HK)** — Citrini-flagged AI drug discovery. HKEX listed.

### Caution
- EWY +99% in 6 months is stretched. New longs need to be selective on entry, not chasing.
- CAPEX growth deceleration narrative emerging (Jukan) — benefits memory pricing near-term but watch for inflection.
- SemiAnalysis VC fund = potential froth signal for US semi valuations (not Korea/Japan).
- $RPI is meme territory — skip.

### Key Event This Week
- **NVIDIA earnings (Feb 26)** — will set tone for entire semi complex. Watch for Vera Rubin timeline, HBM4 commentary, and any Samsung/SK Hynix supply mentions.
